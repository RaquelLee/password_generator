# Password Generator

### A user-selected alphanumeric & special character secure password generator powered by JavaScript.

This was a fun project to complete following an introduction to JavaScript! I enjoyed considering all the ways I could structure the program, and took this project as a challenge to properly implement and build upon all programming logic concepts learned in class, more specifically in JavaScript: string methods, objects, functions, boolean logic, for and while loops.

## Improvements 
As my skills grow, I look forward to updating and extending the JavaScript functionality. I will also be updating the UI/UX to be more in-line with user expectations.
